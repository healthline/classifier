    jsonObj.body = 'Understanding ulcerative colitis Ulcerative colitis is an autoimmune disease, which means it causes your immune system to attack parts of your body. With it, your immune system causes inflammation and ulcers in the lining of your colon. Ulcerative colitis can be more active at times and less active at others. When it’s more active, you have more symptoms. These times are called flare-ups. To help prevent flare-ups, you can try to decrease the amount of fiber in your diet or avoid certain foods that are too spicy, but most people with ulcerative colitis also need the help of drugs. Imuran is a medication that can help manage your symptoms of ulcerative colitis, including stomach cramps and pain, diarrhea, and bloody stool. Imuran for ulcerative colitis Doctors usually prescribe Imuran for people who have tried other drugs that didn’t help relieve their symptoms, such as aminosalicylates and corticosteroids. Imuran is a brand-name oral tablet of the generic drug azathioprine. It belongs to a class of drugs called immunosuppressants, so it works by decreasing your immune system response. This effect reduces inflammation, keeps your symptoms in check, and lowers the chance of flare-ups. It’s used for long-term management of symptoms of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. However, this is an off-label use of Imuran. It may take up to six months for Imuran to begin to relieve your symptoms. Imuran can reduce the damage from inflammation that can lead to hospital visits and the need for surgery. It’s also been shown to reduce the need for corticosteroids that are often used to treat ulcerative colitis. This can be beneficial: corticosteroids can cause more side effects when used for long periods. Side effects of Imuran Imuran can also cause potentially serious side effects, though. While taking it, it’s a good idea to see your doctor as often as they suggest. That way, they can watch you closely for side effects. The milder side effects of Imuran can include nausea and vomiting. The more severe side effects of this drug are below. Increased risk of certain types of cancer Using Imuran for a long time may increase your risk of skin cancer and lymphoma. Lymphoma is a cancer that affects your immune cells. More infections Imuran lowers the activity of your immune system. This means your immune system may not work as well to fight off infections. As a result, infections are a fairly common side effect. Even though they’re common, infections can still be serious. Allergic reaction Symptoms of an allergic reaction usually happen within the first few weeks of treatment. They include: nausea vomiting diarrhea rash fever tiredness muscle aches dizziness If you have these symptoms, contact your doctor right away. Pancreatitis Inflammation of the pancreas is a rare side effect from Imuran. If you have symptoms such as severe stomach pain, vomiting, or oily stools, call your doctor right away. Talk with your doctor Your doctor may suggest Imuran if drugs like aminosalicylates and corticosteroids haven’t worked to control your symptoms from ulcerative colitis. It may help reduce flare-ups and keep your symptoms under control. Imuran comes with the risk of serious side effects, including an increased risk of cancer and infections. Only you and your doctor can decide if this drug is a good choice for you.';

    jsonObj.body = 'What is a stomach ulcer? Stomach ulcers, which are also known as gastric ulcers, are painful sores in the stomach lining. Stomach ulcers are a type of peptic ulcer disease. Peptic ulcers are any ulcers that affect both the stomach and small intestines. Stomach ulcers occur when the thick layer of mucus that protects your stomach from digestive juices is reduced. This allows the digestive acids to eat away at the tissues that line the stomach, causing an ulcer. Stomach ulcers may be easily cured, but they can become severe without proper treatment. What causes stomach ulcers? Stomach ulcers are almost always caused by one of the following: an infection with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen Rarely, a condition known as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome can cause stomach and intestinal ulcers by increasing the body’s production of acid. This syndrome is suspected to cause less than 1 percent of all peptic ulcers. Symptoms of stomach ulcers A number of symptoms are associated with stomach ulcers. The severity of the symptoms depends on the severity of the ulcer. The most common symptom is a burning sensation or pain in the middle of your abdomen between your chest and belly button. Typically, the pain will be more intense when your stomach is empty, and it can last for a few minutes to several hours. Other common signs and symptoms of ulcers include: dull pain in the stomachweight lossnot wanting to eat because of painnausea or vomitingbloatingfeeling easily fullburping or acid refluxheartburn, which is a burning sensation in the chest)pain that may improve when you eat, drink, or take antacidsanemia, whose symptoms can include tiredness, shortness of breath, or paler skindark, tarry stoolsvomit that’s bloody or looks like coffee grounds Talk to your doctor if you have any symptoms of a stomach ulcer. Even though discomfort may be mild, ulcers can worsen if they aren’t treated. Bleeding ulcers can become life-threatening. How are stomach ulcers diagnosed? Diagnosis and treatment will depend on your symptoms and the severity of your ulcer. To diagnose a stomach ulcer, your doctor will review your medical history along with your symptoms and any prescription or over-the-counter medications you’re taking. To rule out H. pylori infection, a blood, stool, or breath test may be ordered. With a breath test, you’ll be instructed to drink a clear liquid and breathe into a bag, which is then sealed. If H. pylori is present, the breath sample will contain higher-than-normal levels of carbon dioxide. Other tests and procedures used to diagnose stomach ulcers include: Barium swallow: You drink a thick white liquid (barium) that coats your upper gastrointestinal tract and helps your doctor see your stomach and small intestine on X-rays.Endoscopy (EGD): A thin, lighted tube is inserted through your mouth and into the stomach and the first part of the small intestine. This test is used to look for ulcers, bleeding, and any tissue that looks abnormal.Endoscopic biopsy: A piece of stomach tissue is removed so it can be analyzed in a lab. Explore the interactive 3-D diagram below to learn more about stomach ulcers. Treating stomach ulcers Treatment will vary depending on the cause of your ulcer. Most ulcers can be treated with a prescription from your doctor, but in rare cases, surgery may be required. It’s important to promptly treat an ulcer. Talk to your doctor to discuss a treatment plan. If you have an actively bleeding ulcer, you’ll likely be hospitalized for intensive treatment with endoscopy and IV ulcer medications. You may also require a blood transfusion. Nonsurgical treatment If your stomach ulcer is the result of H. pylori, you’ll need antibiotics and drugs called proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). PPIs block the stomach cells that produce acid. In addition to these treatments, your doctor may also recommend: H2 receptor blockers (drugs that also block acid production)stopping use of all NSAIDsfollow-up endoscopy probiotics (useful bacteria that may have a role in killing off H. pylori)bismuth supplement Symptoms of an ulcer may subside quickly with treatment. But even if your symptoms disappear, you should continue to take any medication prescribed by your doctor. This is especially important with H. pylori infections, to make sure that all bacteria are eliminated. Side effects of medications used to treat stomach ulcers can include: nauseadizzinessheadachesdiarrheaabdominal pain These side effects are typically temporary. If any of these side effects cause extreme discomfort, talk to your doctor about changing your medication. Surgical treatment In very rare cases, a complicated stomach ulcer will require surgery. This may be the case for ulcers that: continue to returndon’t healbleedtear through the stomach keep food from flowing out of the stomach into the small intestine Surgery may include: removal of the entire ulcertaking tissue from another part of the intestines and patching it over the ulcer sitetying off a bleeding arterycutting off the nerve supply to the stomach to reduce the production of stomach acid Healthful diet In the past, it was thought that diet could cause ulcers. We know now this isn’t true. We also know that while the foods you eat won’t cause or cure a stomach ulcer, eating a healthful diet can benefit your intestinal tract and overall health. In general, it’s a good idea to eat a diet with lots of fruits, vegetables, and fiber. That said, it’s possible that some foods play a role in eliminating H. pylori. Foods that may help fight off H. pylori or boost the body’s own healthy bacteria include: broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and radishesleafy greens, such as spinach and kale probiotic-rich foods, such as sauerkraut, miso, kombucha, yogurt (especially with lactobacillus and Sacharomyces)applesblueberries, raspberries, strawberries, and blackberriesolive oil Additionally, since people with stomach ulcers may have accompanying acid reflux disease, it is a good idea to stay away from spicy and sour foods while an ulcer is healing. Learn more about foods that may be good for stomach ulcers — and foods that may not be. Home remedies for stomach ulcers In addition to eating healthy foods, the following items may help reduce the effects of H. pylori, the bacteria responsible for many stomach ulcers. However, these supplements are not intended to replace prescription medication or your current treatment plan. They include: probioticshoneyglutamine (food sources include chicken, fish, eggs, spinach, and cabbage) Your doctor may also have suggestions for things you can do at home to relieve discomfort from your ulcer. Consider talking to your doctor about these natural and home remedies for ulcers. When should you call or see a doctor? If you think you have a stomach ulcer, call your doctor. Together you can discuss your symptoms and treatment options. It’s important to get a stomach ulcer taken care of because without treatment, ulcers and H. pylori can cause: bleeding from the ulcer site that can become life-threateningpenetration, which occurs when the ulcer goes through the wall of the digestive tract and into another organ, such as the pancreasperforation, which occurs when the ulcer creates a hole in the wall of the digestive tractobstruction (blockage) in the digestive tract, which is due to swelling of inflamed tissues stomach cancer, specifically non-cardia gastric cancer Symptoms of these complications can include those listed below. If you have any of these symptoms, be sure to call you doctor right away: weaknesstrouble breathingred or black vomit or stoolssudden, sharp pain in your abdomen that doesn’t go away Prevention of stomach ulcers To prevent the spread of bacteria that might cause a stomach ulcer, wash your hands with soap and water on a regular basis. Also, be sure to properly clean all of your food and to cook it thoroughly as needed. To prevent ulcers caused by NSAIDs, stop using these medications (if possible) or limit their use. If you need to take NSAIDs, be sure to follow the recommended dosage and avoid alcohol while taking these medications. And always take these medications with food and adequate liquids.

Treatments for\r\nthe inflammatory disease aim to extend periods of remission and make flare-ups\r\nless severe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For people with severe UC, curative surgery is a possible treatment.\r\nRemoving the entire large intestine (<a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/large-bowel-resection\">total colectomy</a>)\r\nwill end the symptoms of the disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This procedure requires your doctor to create a pouch on the\r\noutside of your body where waste can empty.
